# Branding App

This is a React-based multi-step branding brief application. It guides clients through a series of questions about their brand, atmosphere, audience, references, and expectations. After each step, the app displays AI-like comments to inspire and guide the user. At the end, a summary is generated with recommendations and the user is thanked. The app features a dark-themed UI with green and orange accents and smooth transitions between steps.
